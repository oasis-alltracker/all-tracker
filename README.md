# Open Source License Agreement
This open-source license agreement ("Agreement") applies to any recipient ("Recipient") who copies, modifies, merges, publishes, distributes, sublicenses, or sells copies of the software ("Software") in this repository.

## Decleration
The name of this repository is officially: **Oasis: All-Tracker**.

The Software in this repository is monitored and maintained by *Aidan Andrew-Hodgert* and *Oasis: All-Tracker* (**business**).

The term *all-tracker* was invented by Aidan Andrew-Hodgert on January of 2022. An *all-tracker* is defined as a journal that allows a user to record metrics and insights of their day to day life, with the hopes of bettering one's self. Examples of such metrics include sleep, fitness, habits, diet, mood, and to-dos. In its inception Aidan's wish was that no one or entity could own the idea in the hopes that others could use the idea he created and the code in this repository to innovate and create better *all-trackers*.

There also exists an entity of the same name, *Oasis: All-Tracker*. This entity is a business based out of Manitoba that aims to promote the idea of *all-trackers* and make them more accessible and user friendly. *Oasis: All-Tracker* (**business**) created the original iteration of an all-tracker which was released on August of 2023, and is an application developed using Notion and can be found [here](https://possible-sled-8e4.notion.site/Oasis-All-Tracker-cfa238e67485440ca3556921f4029dc1).
*Oasis: All-Tracker* (**business**) has deployed the backend Software and uploaded binaries built from the front-end Software to both Apple and Google stores. The logo images included in the Software are owned by *Oasis: All-Tracker* (**business**) and all contain the word 'logo' in their name. These logo images are proprietary to *Oasis: All-Tracker* (**business**) and Recipient must obtain proper licenses for their use as outlined in this Agreement.

To reiterate, *Oasis: All-Tracker* (**business**) (which has released a binary of this application) and this code base, also known as **Oasis: All-Tracker** are not one in the same. *Oasis: All-Tracker* (**business**) would like to promote the idea, and so they plan to regularly release new verions of the Software to the app stores.
