The name of this repository is officially "Oasis: All-Tracker" and is owned by no one, the code base itself is monitored by Aidan Andrew-Hodgert. 
The code in this repository is free for all and can be used by anyone.

The term and application "all-tracker" was invented by Aidan Andrew-Hodgert in January of 2022.
An all-tracker is defined to be a journal that allows a user to record metrics and insights of their day to day life.
Examples of such metrics include sleep, fitness, habits, to-dos, etc.

Aidan's wish is that no entity owns this idea and that others can use the idea and code in this repository to innovate and create better all-trackers.

The open-source code (Oasis: All-Tracker) associated with this invention is not proprietary to any company. It is available for public use, modification, and distribution under [Apache license 2.0].
Our utilization of this open-source code does not limit or restrict its availability to other entities.

There is also an existing entity of the same name, "Oasis: All-Tracker". This entity is a business based out of Manitoba that aims to promote the idea of all-trackers and make them more accessible and user friendly.
Oasis created the original iteration of an all-tracker which was released on August of 2023, and is an application developed using Notion and can be found at this link: https://possible-sled-8e4.notion.site/Oasis-All-Tracker-cfa238e67485440ca3556921f4029dc1

"Oasis: All-Tracker" (business) has deployed the backend code in this repositry and uploaded the front-end binaries of this code on both Apple and Google stores.

Again, we would like to highlight that the entity "Oasis: All-Tracker" (which has released a binary of this application of the same name) and this code base, also know as "Oasis: All-Tracker" are not one in the same. "Oasis: All-Tracker" (business) would like to promote the idea, and so they plan to regularly release verions of this code base to the app store.

Despite Oasis's(business) terms of agreement all are welcome to deploy versions of this application, given that the necessary image licenses are obtained.
Oasis (business) has all the necessary licenses for images and logos, so for more information on obtaining permission to use the images please contatact them via email at oasis@oasis-alltracker.com
